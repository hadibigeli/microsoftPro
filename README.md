# MicrosoftPro Web Page

This project is a **responsive web page** built  **Tailwind CSS**, designed to replicate the look and feel of a Microsoft-style interface. The project leverages Tailwind CSS for streamlined styling and responsive breakpoints, alongside live server integration for quick local development and real-time updates.

## Project Structure

- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for utility-first, responsive styling.
- **Live Server**: Runs a local development server with auto-reload functionality.
- **Swiper.js**: Enables smooth, responsive carousels and sliders.
